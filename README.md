 # Getting started
 
- This is an example repository for [Trading Strategy framework](https://tradingstrategy.ai) to 
  get started bringing your [algorithmic trading strategy](https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/algorithmic-trading) to decentralised finance
- This allows you to develop and backtest your trading strategies against DeFi and [Binance CEX](https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/cex) data

# Prerequisites

- Github user account 
  - The Docker container image running the development environment is hosted on [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/features/packages)
- Basic Python and data science knowledge
  - Python scripting
  - Pandas
  - Jupyter Notebook
- Basic algorithmic trading knowledge 
  - Understanding price chart and price action
  - Technical indicators

For complex strategies that process a lot of data we recommend running a local development environment with minimum of 16 GB RAM.
